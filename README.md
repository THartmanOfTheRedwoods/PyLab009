# PyLab009 - Book Cipher

This lab is going to be a walk-through lab, meaning we are going to be doing it together in class and you have to be present to complete it. The overall concept is implementing a Book Cipher, or a cipher that utilizes the pages, lines, and characters of a book (or n books) to encrypt and decrypt a message. Thus, it is a simple substitution cipher, but one that allows for no re-use of already utilized substitution blocks. This makes it theoretically very difficult to crack unless one possesses the book(s) used as the key. Nonetheless, this also requires both sides to share a common book or key, which makes the cipher much more difficult to implement for remote offices.

We will go over the details of this lab in class, so be present!
